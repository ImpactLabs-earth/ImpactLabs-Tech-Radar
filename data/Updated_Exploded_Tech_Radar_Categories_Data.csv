The platform connects consumers with certified refurbishers, ensuring that products undergo thorough inspection and repair before resale.

By focusing on refurbished products, Back Market encourages a shift away from the linear ""take-make-dispose"" model, allowing consumers to purchase high-quality devices at reduced prices while minimizing environmental impact. This approach helps divert electronic waste from landfills and promotes resource efficiency by maximizing the use of existing materials.

Back Market also emphasizes transparency, providing detailed information about the refurbishment process and warranty options, which builds consumer trust in purchasing second-hand electronics. Through its initiatives, Back Market not only offers an eco-friendly alternative to new devices but also fosters a culture of sustainability by educating consumers about the benefits of choosing refurbished products over new ones.",,,,,,,refurbished tech better planet back market trade inuschoose locationchanging location might affect delivery address options price product availability

Founded in 2015, it focuses on verifying the authenticity, provenance, and sustainability of high-value assets such as diamonds, minerals, and luxury goods. By using digital records and product passports, Everledger helps businesses ensure responsible sourcing and enhance consumer trust. Through blockchain technology, they create digital product passports that allow companies to track an asset’s lifecycle, from raw material sourcing to recycling. This encourages responsible sourcing, reduces waste, and enables the recovery of valuable materials for reuse. Their work helps businesses adopt sustainable practices, such as ethical mining and recycling of e-waste, which are essential to achieving circular economies.",2015.0,,,,,,main home everledger request

It provides the tools to achieve traceability of materials and products ensuring origin, attributes and compliance with standards by forcing accountability along the supply chain. By using a distributed ledger technology, Foodchain network can interface with third parties supply chains providing the ability to monitor physical items and transmit data associated with them, enabling transparency at any point of the supply chain and allowing buyers to be engaged at the point of sale.
Foodchain network collects data from sensors and tags like QR codes, RFID and NFC and assures full integrity of the readings and compatibility with third parties existing software.

Foodchain is a vertical application that focuses on the food industry however it is part of a broader decentralized network that extends into various fields of the internet of Things. In fact, the same protocol is applied to track objects throughout any kind of supply chain or to support the management of digital assets such as digital ID, banking transactions and cloud data storage.

Besides a willing and skilled development team, Foodchain can actually rely on a trustful network of consultant and advisors which collaborates in the creation of our open source

LANDex aims to place people at the center of land data, democratizing land monitoring and building a data ecosystem that better captures the complex experience of land governance from diverse perspectives.
By providing a platform for diverse data sources and perspectives, LANDex seeks to inform national, regional, and global land governance processes, offering evidence-based insights to guide policy reforms and elevate the voices of individuals and communities often absent in official statistics.",2019.0,,"People-Centered Data: LANDex promotes the inclusion of data from diverse sources, highlighting the people, communities, and concerns often underrepresented in official numbers.
Alignment with Global Frameworks: The index evaluates how ILC is contributing to the realization of people-centered land governance while allowing members to contribute directly to the implementation and monitoring of global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGTs). 
Data for Advocacy: LANDex is a visually attractive and accessible online tool, displaying fully searchable and downloadable data that can be displayed by indicator, commitment, or country. It is made available to policymakers, change-makers, the media, and the general public to generate narratives and powerful evidence-based advocacy based on people-centered data.
Comprehensive Indicators: LANDex comprises 33 indicators organized according to the 10 Commitments to People-Centered Land Governance (PCLG). These indicators are set on a standard scale of 0-100, where 100 is the most desirable score, allowing for simplified comparison across indicators, commitments, and countries.",,,,landex global land governance index facebook twitter drag commitment 5 commitment 2 commitment 1 commitment 3 commitment 6 commitment 8 commitment 7 commitment 9 commitment 10 touch commitment 4 external embed click left link youtube download search search en español english français latest view use data methodology submit data index landex people data land landex global land governance index puts people center land data democratizing land monitoring building data ecosystem voices heard learn accountability people data collected identified landex used hold relevant actors accountable landex data contributes monitoring major development rights based frameworks methodology important issues landex monitors land governance according 10 commitments international land coalition data collected centralised various sources gives comprehensive understanding state land governance country according legal framework levels implementation outcomes landex methodology index country landex score set scale 0 100 100 desirable country score reflects average landex indicators country also set standard scale 0 100 view index reporting visualisation scores country visualised interactive map allows users click country find land governance users also filter data according relevant thematics frameworks seen left look live data global index say landex puts people center land governance monitoring caputure diverse perpectives crucial elements land governace across indicators rely input individuals communities represent different sectors land community provide data impact data generated identified landex itended inform national regional global land governance processes providing evidence based insights guide policy reforms elevating voices individuals communities groups often absent official numbers 28 may 2019 landex training central asia held mongolia 14 jun 2019 nepal officials consider landex tool national processes 21 jul 2020 landex kenya data better land governance impact stories data view submit index actions log privacy policy sign newsletter ilc 2025 site dev,Impact Databases

printempsdesterres fr la restauration de tourbières dégradées lorsqu elles sont en bon état les tourbières ont un rôle essentiel pour le stockage de carbone ainsi les émissions provenant des tourbières dégradées pourraient consommer à elles seules 41 du budget carbone qui reste à l humanité pour limiter le réchauffement climatique à 1 5 c ici à 2100 les tourbières sont des écosystèmes rares qu il est essentiel de restaurer et préserver source daniel gilbert professeur à l université de franche comté cité par lan wei dans l article du monde les tourbières des écosystèmes clés pour atteindre les objectifs climatiques 2 mai 2023 la création de continuités écologiques dits corridors ou trames elles servent à assurer les déplacements des espèces entre les réservoirs de biodiversité qu il agisse de déplacements routiniers de dispersion habitat alimentation ou de migration cela peut se traduire par la replantation de haies ou encore de ripisylves végétation bordant les milieux

That is why at OpenSC, we work in key commodities with large companies to VERIFY low-carbon and sustainable food production at source.

Co-founded by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and BCG Digital Ventures, OpenSC is a social impact venture headquartered in Sydney.

Our platform uses data collected directly from our customer’s supply chains and continuously analyses it to VERIFY claims such as:
- Ensuring truly deforestation-free palm oil: We verify that palm oil fruit actually come from legal and deforestation-free plantations
- Confirming the right payments to coffee farmers: We verify fair payment to every farmer - the key to ensuring a living income and reducing land-use-change pressure
- Only fishing where it is sustainable to do so: We verify that no fishing happens in marine reserves and our technology can continuously monitor where fishing happens

With VERIFY as our core, TRACE (tracing products throughout supply chains) and SHARE (sharing powerful information B2B and B2C) complete the ecosystem. ",2019.0,,,,,,,Supply Chain Transparency

The platform’s integration of social networking features—such as user connections, ""Posh Parties,"" and live auctions—encourages interaction and sustainable fashion practices by keeping items in circulation and out of landfills. Since its inception, Poshmark has helped keep over 300 million items in circulation.

The platform has also embraced live shopping events to further support sustainability. For example, during Earth Month, Poshmark collaborated with sustainable fashion brands to host live shows where items are auctioned off, encouraging users to participate in the secondhand economy. Additionally, they promote the use of recycled packaging and provide upcycling tips to their community to further reduce environmental impact. By combining digital tools like the ""Share Shows"" feature with a focus on community, Poshmark strengthens its role in circular fashion, making secondhand shopping more accessible and socially engaging.",,,,,,,poshmark buy sell fashion home decor beauty website requires javascript log sign buy sell discover fashion home decor beauty sign join millions people social marketplace things style continue facebookcontinue googlecontinue apple sign email stay signed uncheck using public device show works seller buyer list closet full clothes never wear snap photo price list less 60 seconds right phone share share listings followers use daily themed posh parties help shoppers discover listings sharing sales earn cash shipping easy prepaid labels earn cash item delivered shop sell confidence protected payments ordered guarantee give money back learn posh authenticate offer free item authentication free shipping items 500 learn usps ground advantage orders ship via usps ground advantage without prepaid shipping shipping never easier learn download app free iphone ipad android shop categories women men kids home electronics pets handbags shoes jewelry accessories makeup dresses popular brands nike michael kors louis vuitton lululemon athletica pink victoria secret coach chanel see brands company community blog faqs live shopping sell poshmark works gift cards careers press accessibility buy sell app connect us shop united states canadaunited states 2025 poshmark inc privacyterms contact opt rights,End Of Life / Circularity

The company focuses on using digital technology to track and manage reusable packaging through a platform that creates ""digital passports"" for each item. These passports store data on the packaging's lifecycle, including its usage, interactions, and location as it moves through distribution chains. This enables businesses to transition from single-use to reusable systems in a compliant and scalable way.

The platform offers flexible traceability tools, allowing businesses to track packaging from production through its in-use phase to its eventual end-of-life. It also provides powerful analytics that helps businesses monitor the performance of their packaging systems and optimize them for efficiency. The aim is to reduce waste and increase the lifespan of materials, supporting a more sustainable circular economy.

Reath's innovative approach is powered by a machine-readable system, often using QR codes or similar technologies, which helps businesses maintain the transparency needed for circular supply chains. They have been backed by several impact-focused investors and are continuously developing their http://reuse.id/ standard, which seeks to create a global open data standard for reusable packaging",,,,,,,reath packaging data epr ram tools sustainable packagingsolutionsreusable packaging traceabilityreusable packaging analyticspackaging comparator tooldigital product passportsindustriespackaging manufacturersretailershospitalitymanufacturing brandspackaging typesprimarysecondarytakeawaypricingresourcescase studiesresearchuk extended producer responsibilityuk plastic packaging taxreusable packaging guideloginbook callmenusolutionsreusable packaging traceabilityreusable packaging analyticspackaging comparator tooldigital product passportsindustriespackaging manufacturersretailershospitalitymanufacturing brandspackaging typesprimarysecondarytakeawaypricingresourcescase studiesresearchuk extended producer responsibilityuk plastic packaging taxreusable packaging guideloginbook callthe packaging data expertsreduce costs increase sustainability prove book demoreath packaging comparison tool allows choose 3 impactful pacakging projects instead spreading team thin across 20 possible optionsbiffa calculate manage share access standard packaging data plus carbon calculations material usage costs one place simplify epr ram carry recycling assessments calculate fees minutes hours understand full impact instantly calculate financial environmental packaging costs one place report packaging data manage share epr ram data compliance agencies supply chain partners learn compare seconds model achievable packaging changes ease compare cost carbon material use understand trade offs different packaging types glance make smarter decisions model scenarios quickly see switching materials weights recyclability changes costs emissions build business case change automatically generate business case tailored business needs learn tracking reusables ready go beyond packaging assessments track trace system makes simple manage reusable packaging scale android app scan packaging every step journey easy use mobile app track trace see packaging every step journey deployment return monitor optimise monitor key metrics like reuse rate cycle time optimise bottlenecks reduce costs full lifecycle visibility gain complete overview packaging journey deployment recovery reuse one place learn get started todaydon wait start making data driven decisions todaycontact usbook demo 2025 reath technology ltdcookie settingslegalprivacy policyabout reathour storycareersnewsby using website agree cookie policy settingsreject allaccept allcookie settingswe use cookies improve user experience choose cookie categories allow us use read cookie policy clicking cookie policy essential required cookies enable strictly necessary cookies security language support verification identity cookies disabled functionalitythese cookies collect data remember choices users make improve give better user experience disabling cause parts site work properly performance analyticsthese cookies help us understand visitors interact website help us measure analyze traffic improve service targeting advertisingthese cookies help us better deliver marketing content customized ads view cookie policysave,End Of Life / Circularity

They offer services that allow consumers to resell their pre-owned items through the brand’s own channels, helping brands with sustainability and customer loyalty. Reflaunt integrates with brand websites to enable a simple resale process that can be applied to any type of textile company, from outdoors apparel to luxury, but also resale marketplaces. Reflaunt overall enhances the lifespan and value of fashion items.

By partnering with brands and retailers, Reflaunt allows users to easily sell their unwanted clothing and accessories, thereby extending the life cycle of these products and reducing waste.

The platform simplifies the resale process, offering users a seamless experience to list items, manage sales, and receive payments. This encourages consumers to rethink their relationship with fashion, shifting from a linear ""buy-use-dispose"" mentality to one that values sustainability and resource efficiency.

Reflaunt's business model supports brands in embracing circular economy principles by providing them with tools to create their own resale channels.

For example, Rheaply helped RUSH University Medical Center avoid over 53,000 pounds of waste and save $244,000 by rehoming surplus furniture during a demolition project. Additionally, Rheaply incorporates data insights to support efficient asset utilization and reduce unnecessary procurement. This promotes cost savings and reduces environmental impact by lowering embodied carbon and avoiding the waste associated with new resource extraction.",,,,,,,,End Of Life / Circularity

By providing a marketplace for users to buy and sell pre-owned clothes, thredUP helps extend the lifecycle of garments, reducing the need for new production and lowering fashion-related waste and carbon emissions.

One of its key innovations is the ""Resale-as-a-Service"" (RaaS) platform. This system allows brands and retailers like Gap, Reformation, and Abercrombie & Fitch to integrate secondhand options into their operations. Customers can use thredUP's ""Clean Out Kits"" to send in their used clothing, which is then listed for resale or properly recycled if it doesn’t meet quality standards.

ThredUP’s digital infrastructure automates much of the resale process, including photographing, pricing, and listing items, which improves efficiency and scalability. This enables thredUP to handle billions of unique items, making secondhand shopping easy for consumers while promoting sustainability on a large scale",,,,,,,,End Of Life / Circularity

The platform integrates a price recommendation algorithm to guide users in setting the right prices for items, encouraging more people to participate in the secondhand market.

To reduce environmental impact, Vestiaire Collective also factors location into search and matching functions to minimize unnecessary shipping distances. This localized approach aligns with its sustainability mission, cutting down carbon emissions associated with global transportation. Additionally, the platform uses AI to enhance product classification and discovery, ensuring a smooth and efficient shopping experience.

Vestiaire Collective has also implemented policies to remove fast fashion brands from the platform, shifting buyers toward higher-quality, longer-lasting items. These efforts not only support circularity but also educate consumers on more sustainable fashion choices. This initiative has already shown positive results, with a significant percentage of fast fashion buyers switching to better quality alternatives.",,,,,,,,End Of Life / Circularity
